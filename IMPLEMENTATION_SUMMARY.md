---

### 🔧 Configuration Files

✅ Updated:
- `package.json` - Added deployment scripts
- `.gitignore` - Added Hardhat artifacts
- `hardhat.config.ts` - Network configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config (from base)

✅ NPM Scripts:
```bash
npm run compile           # Compile contracts
npm run deploy:sepolia    # Deploy to testnet
npm run deploy:mainnet    # Deploy to mainnet
npm run create-game:sepolia  # Create game on testnet
npm run node              # Start local Hardhat node
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Game Flow

1. **Admin Creates Game**
   - Navigate to `/admin`
   - Fill in prize, sponsor, duration details
   - Transaction creates game on-chain
   - Game ID emitted in event

2. **Players Compete**
   - Visit main page
   - Connect wallet
   - Click "GRAB IT NOW!" to claim
   - Previous holder's time is calculated and stored
   - New holder starts accumulating time
   - Leaderboard updates in real-time

3. **Game Ends**
   - Timer reaches zero
   - Anyone can call `closeGame()`
   - Contract calculates winner
   - Winner displayed on UI

### Technical Flow

## 🚀 Next Steps to Launch

### 1. Deploy Contract (5 minutes)
```bash
npm run compile
npm run deploy:sepolia
# Copy contract address to .env
```

### 2. Create First Game (2 minutes)
```bash
# Update .env with game parameters
npm run create-game:sepolia
# Copy game ID to .env
```

### 3. Test Locally (10 minutes)
```bash
npm run dev
# Test claiming, leaderboard, etc.
```

### 4. Deploy Frontend (5 minutes)
```bash
vercel --prod
# Add env vars in Vercel dashboard
```

### 5. Production Deploy (10 minutes)
```bash
npm run deploy:mainnet
# Create production game
# Update Vercel env vars
```

**Total Time: ~30 minutes to production** 🎉

- Game duration
- Claim cooldown
- Prize values and currency
- Sponsor branding
- UI styling (CSS modules)
- Network (Base, other EVM chains)

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Optional)
